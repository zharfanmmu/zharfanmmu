## About Me

Hello there! My name is Zharfan. I am a first year Ph.D. student at Multimedia University in Malaysia. My research is concerned with using machine learning for the classification of hyperspectral images. I am very passionate about technologies in general but I decided to specialize in Artificial Intelligence.

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/zharfanmmu/zharfanmmu/edit/gh-pages/index.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/zharfanmmu/zharfanmmu/settings/pages). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
